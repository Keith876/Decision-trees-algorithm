# Decision-trees-algorithm
#### Project Overview
This project uses a decision tree algorithm to predict whether a person will buy a computer based on their age, income level, and student status. The goal is to create an interpretable model for decision-making.
The decision tree algorithm splits the data based on feature values to classify whether a person buys a computer. It is trained to minimize misclassification errors while maintaining interpretability.
#### Limitations
1.	The model assumes no external factors influence purchase decisions.
2.	Simplified feature categories may not capture all real-world complexities
